# Arrow Drawing Program
This C program allows you to draw an arrow-like pattern using ASCII characters. You can specify the height of the arrow, and the program will generate and display the arrow pattern on the console.

## Features
- Draw an arrow pattern using ASCII characters.
- Specify the height of the arrow within a defined range.
- Visualize the arrow pattern on the console.

## Requirements
- C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Command-line interface

## How to Use
1. Compile the program using a C compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable in your terminal.
3. Follow the prompt to provide the height of the arrow. Input a number between MIN_HEIGHT and MAX_HEIGHT, as defined in the program. If you input an invalid height, the program will ask you to enter a valid one.
4. After entering the height, the program will display the arrow pattern on the console.
